☕ Java Virtual Machine (JVM) – 10 Questions

What is the JVM?  
ans.) JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine. It runs Java bytecode and allows Java programs to be platform-independent.  
eg.) Like a universal DVD player that can play any Java movie regardless of the country.

What is the role of the JVM in Java execution?  
ans.) It loads, verifies, and executes Java bytecode.  
eg.) Like a chef who reads a recipe (bytecode) and prepares the dish (program output).

What is bytecode?  
ans.) Bytecode is an intermediate code generated by the Java compiler that the JVM can understand.  
eg.) Like a PDF file that can be opened on any device.

Is JVM platform-independent?  
ans.) No, JVM is platform-specific, but Java is platform-independent because of JVM.  
eg.) Like different chargers for different countries, but they all charge the same phone.

What are the main components of the JVM?  
ans.) Class loader, runtime data areas, execution engine, and native method interface.

What is the class loader in JVM?  
ans.) It loads class files into memory when required.  
eg.) Like a librarian fetching a book only when someone asks for it.

What is the execution engine in JVM?  
ans.) It executes the bytecode using either an interpreter or JIT compiler.  
eg.) Like a translator who reads and speaks the instructions in real time.

What is JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler?  
ans.) It converts bytecode into native machine code at runtime for better performance.  
eg.) Like a chef who starts cooking only when the order is placed.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?  
ans.) JVM runs the code; JRE includes JVM and libraries needed to run Java programs.  
eg.) JVM is the engine, JRE is the whole car.

Can we run Java code without JVM?  
ans.) No, JVM is essential to run Java bytecode.

🧠 Memory Management in JVM – 10 Questions

What is memory management in Java?  
ans.) It refers to how memory is allocated and freed during program execution.

What are the main memory areas in JVM?  
ans.) Heap, Stack, Method Area, Program Counter Register, and Native Method Stack.

What is the heap memory?  
ans.) It stores objects and class instances.  
eg.) Like a warehouse where all products (objects) are stored.

What is stack memory?  
ans.) It stores method calls and local variables.  
eg.) Like a stack of plates where the last one added is the first one removed.

What is the method area?  
ans.) It stores class-level data like static variables and method definitions.  
eg.) Like a blueprint room where all designs are kept.

What is the garbage collector in Java?  
ans.) It automatically removes unused objects from heap memory.  
eg.) Like a cleaning robot that removes unused items from a room.

When does garbage collection occur?  
ans.) It runs automatically, but we can suggest it using System.gc().

What is memory leak in Java?  
ans.) When objects are no longer used but not garbage collected due to lingering references.  
eg.) Like keeping old clothes in your closet that you never wear.

What is OutOfMemoryError?  
ans.) It occurs when JVM cannot allocate memory for new objects.  
eg.) Like trying to store more files in a full hard drive.

What is the difference between heap and stack memory?  
ans.) Heap is for objects; stack is for method calls and local variables.

⚙️ Static Keyword – 10 Questions

What does static mean in Java?  
ans.) It means the member belongs to the class, not to any specific object.  
eg.) Like a school rule that applies to all students, not just one.

Can we access static methods without creating an object?  
ans.) Yes, static methods can be accessed using the class name directly.  
eg.) Like using a public notice board without needing a key.

What is a static block?  
ans.) A block that runs once when the class is loaded.  
eg.) Like setting up a stage before the play begins.

What is a static variable?  
ans.) A variable shared by all instances of a class.  
eg.) Like a shared Wi-Fi password for everyone in a building.

Can we override static methods?  
ans.) No, static methods cannot be overridden because they belong to the class, not the object.

Can a static method access instance variables?  
ans.) No, static methods cannot directly access instance variables or methods.  
eg.) Like a school rule not being able to refer to a specific student’s locker.

Can we use `this` keyword inside a static method?  
ans.) No, because `this` refers to the current object, and static methods do not belong to any object.

Can a class be static in Java?  
ans.) Only nested (inner) classes can be declared static, not top-level classes.  
eg.) Like a static room inside a building, but the building itself can't be static.

What happens if we declare the main method as non-static?  
ans.) The JVM won't be able to call it without creating an object, so the program won't run.

Can static methods be inherited?  
ans.) Yes, static methods are inherited but not overridden.  
eg.) Like a family tradition passed down, but not changed by each generation.

🔒 Final Keyword – 5 Questions

What does final mean in Java?  
ans.) It means the value, method, or class cannot be changed, overridden, or extended.  
eg.) Like sealing a letter—you can read it, but not edit it.

Can we reassign a final variable?  
ans.) No, once a final variable is assigned, it cannot be changed.  
eg.) Like setting a permanent password that can’t be updated.

Can we override a final method?  
ans.) No, final methods cannot be overridden in subclasses.  
eg.) Like a company policy that even managers can't change.

Can we extend a final class?  
ans.) No, final classes cannot be inherited.  
eg.) Like a sealed box that no one can add to or modify.

What is the difference between final and finally?  
ans.) `final` is a keyword for constants, `finally` is a block used in exception handling.  
eg.) Final is like a locked value, finally is like a cleanup crew that always shows up.

🔤 Strings – 10 Questions

1. What is a String in Java?  
ans.) A String is an object that represents a sequence of characters. It’s stored as a char array internally and provides methods for inspection and manipulation.  

2. Why are Strings immutable in Java?  
ans.) Once created, a String’s content can’t change. This allows safe sharing across threads and enables the String pool to reuse instances.  

3. What is the String pool?  
ans.) A special area in heap memory where literal Strings are interned. When you create a literal, Java checks the pool first and reuses existing instances to save memory.  

4. How do `==` and `equals()` differ when comparing Strings?  
ans.) `==` checks if both references point to the same object; `equals()` checks if their character sequences match.  

5. How does `new String("abc")` differ from `"abc"`?  
ans.) `"abc"` refers to a pooled literal; `new String("abc")` always creates a fresh object on the heap.  

6. What does `intern()` do on a String?  
ans.) It adds the String to the pool (if not present) and returns the pooled reference, letting you reuse or share literals.  

7. How do you concatenate Strings, and what’s the performance impact?  
ans.) Using `+` or `concat()`. Each operation creates a new String, which is costly in loops—better to use a mutable builder.  
eg.) Like copying a document each time you add a line instead of using a draft that you revise.

8. How do you convert a String to an integer?  
ans.) Use `Integer.parseInt(str)` or `Integer.valueOf(str)`. The former returns a primitive, the latter an `Integer` object.  

9. What do `substring(begin, end)` and `substring(begin)` return?  
ans.) They return a new String containing characters from the specified range. Characters are copied for Java 7+; earlier versions shared the same char array.  

10. How do you extract individual characters from a String?  
ans.) Use `charAt(index)` to get a single char, or `toCharArray()` to get all characters in an array.  

🔧 StringBuffer – 10 Questions

11. What is StringBuffer?  
ans.) A mutable sequence of characters, similar to String but allows in-place modification without creating new objects.  

12. How does StringBuffer differ from String?  
ans.) String is immutable—each change creates a new object. StringBuffer modifies its internal array, changing content directly.  

13. Is StringBuffer thread-safe?  
ans.) Yes. Most methods are `synchronized`, ensuring only one thread can modify the buffer at a time.  

14. How does StringBuffer ensure thread safety?  
ans.) By marking key methods (`append`, `insert`, etc.) as `synchronized`, it serializes access from multiple threads.  

15. How do you append text to a StringBuffer?  
ans.) Call `buffer.append("text")`. It expands its internal array if needed and returns the same buffer.  

16. How do you insert text at a specific position?  
ans.) Use `buffer.insert(index, "text")`. The existing characters shift to accommodate the new content.  

17. How do you delete a range of characters?  
ans.) Use `buffer.delete(start, end)`. Characters from start up to end–1 are removed and the rest shift left.  

18. What does `reverse()` do on a StringBuffer?  
ans.) It reverses the character sequence in place and returns the same buffer.  

19. How do you check and grow capacity?  
ans.) `capacity()` returns current buffer size; `ensureCapacity(min)` increases it if `min` exceeds current capacity.  

20. How do you replace a substring?  
ans.) Use `buffer.replace(start, end, "newText")`. The range is deleted and replaced with newText, resizing if needed.  

🛠 StringBuilder – 10 Questions

21. What is StringBuilder?  
ans.) A mutable character sequence like StringBuffer but without synchronized methods, optimized for single-threaded use.  

22. How does StringBuilder differ from StringBuffer?  
ans.) It’s non-thread-safe and faster because it omits synchronization overhead.  

23. When should you choose StringBuilder over StringBuffer?  
ans.) When building or modifying strings in a single thread, such as constructing SQL queries or generating JSON.  

24. How do you append text to a StringBuilder?  
ans.) Call `builder.append("text")`. It modifies the internal array and returns the builder.  

25. How do you insert text at a given index?  
ans.) Use `builder.insert(index, "text")`, shifting existing characters to the right.  

26. How do you delete characters from a StringBuilder?  
ans.) Use `builder.delete(start, end)` to remove the specified range in place.  

27. How do you reverse the content of a StringBuilder?  
ans.) Call `builder.reverse()`. The method flips the character sequence and returns the builder.  

28. What are capacity and length in StringBuilder?  
ans.) `capacity()` shows the allocated array size; `length()` shows the number of characters currently stored.  

29. How do you ensure a minimum capacity?  
ans.) Call `builder.ensureCapacity(min)`, which expands the internal array if `min` is larger than current capacity.  

30. How do you convert a StringBuilder back to String?  
ans.) Use `builder.toString()`, which constructs and returns a new immutable String with the builder’s content.
